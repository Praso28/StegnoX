# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 2 of the StegnoX project, which focused on enhancing the backend API.

## 1. Enhanced API Structure

### API Versioning
- Implemented a versioned API structure with `/api/v1` prefix
- Created a modular blueprint-based architecture
- Added proper error handling and response formatting

### Configuration System
- Created a flexible configuration system with different environments (development, testing, production)
- Implemented environment-specific settings
- Added configuration for file uploads, JWT, database, storage, and queue

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### User Management
- Implemented a User model for authentication
- Created a simple JSON-based user database
- Added user registration and login functionality

### JWT Authentication
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Created decorators for protecting routes
- Added role-based authorization (user/admin)

## 3. Job Management

### Job API

- Created endpoints for analyzing images
- Added support for selecting specific analysis methods
- Implemented result storage and retrieval

### Encoding Endpoints
- Added endpoints for encoding messages in images
- Implemented support for different encoding methods
- Created utilities for handling encoded images

## 6. Testing and Documentation

### API Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation for all endpoints
- Added usage examples
- Documented authentication and authorization

### Testing
- Implemented unit tests for the backend
- Added test cases for authentication, job management, and analysis
- Created a test environment configuration

## Next Steps

The completion of Phase 2 provides a robust backend API for the StegnoX application. The next phases will focus on:

1. **Frontend Enhancement**: Improving the user interface and adding advanced features
2. **Desktop Application Enhancement**: Enhancing the desktop GUI with more features
3. **Testing and Documentation**: Expanding test coverage and improving documentation
4. **Deployment and Distribution**: Setting up deployment pipeline and preparing for distribution
5. **Security and Performance**: Enhancing security and optimizing performance
