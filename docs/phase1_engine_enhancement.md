# Phase 1: Steganography Engine Enhancement

This document outlines the implementation details for enhancing the StegnoX engine capabilities.

## New Extraction Algorithms

### 1. DCT-Based Steganography Detection

The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is commonly used in JPEG compression and can be exploited for steganography.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a new method `dct_analysis` in the `StegnoxEngine` class
- Use the DCT to transform image blocks
- Analyze coefficient patterns for anomalies
- Detect modifications in the frequency domain
- Return detected hidden data or confidence score

```python
def dct_analysis(self, image_path):
    """
    Analyze DCT coefficients for signs of steganography
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Analysis results
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

### 2. Bit Plane Analysis

Bit plane analysis separates an image into its constituent bit planes to detect anomalies.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a new method `bit_plane_analysis` in the `StegnoxEngine` class
- Extract individual bit planes from the image
- Analyze each plane for statistical anomalies
- Detect patterns that indicate hidden data
- Return analysis results with visualization data

```python
def bit_plane_analysis(self, image_path):
    """
    Analyze bit planes for signs of steganography
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Analysis results with bit plane data
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

### 3. Histogram Analysis

Statistical analysis of image histograms can reveal steganographic modifications.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a new method `histogram_analysis` in the `StegnoxEngine` class
- Generate histograms for each color channel
- Analyze histogram patterns for anomalies
- Compare with expected distributions
- Return analysis results with visualization data

```python
def histogram_analysis(self, image_path):
    """
    Analyze image histograms for signs of steganography
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Analysis results with histogram data
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

## Encoding Methods

### 1. LSB Encoding

Implement LSB encoding to complement the existing extraction method.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a new method `lsb_encoding` in the `StegnoxEngine` class
- Take input message and target image
- Embed message bits in the least significant bits of pixel values
- Add terminator sequence
- Save the resulting image

```python
def lsb_encoding(self, image_path, message, output_path):
    """
    Encode a message using LSB steganography
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the cover image
        message (str): Message to hide
        output_path (str): Path to save the resulting image
        
    Returns:
        bool: Success status
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

### 2. Parity Bit Encoding

Implement parity-based encoding for steganography.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a new method `parity_bit_encoding` in the `StegnoxEngine` class
- Take input message and target image
- Modify pixel values to achieve desired parity based on message bits
- Save the resulting image

```python
def parity_bit_encoding(self, image_path, message, output_path):
    """
    Encode a message using parity bit steganography
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the cover image
        message (str): Message to hide
        output_path (str): Path to save the resulting image
        
    Returns:
        bool: Success status
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

## Format Support

### 1. Format-Specific Handlers

Implement handlers for different image formats.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a format detection method
- Implement format-specific processing for JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.
- Add validation for each format
- Optimize algorithms based on format characteristics

```python
def detect_format(self, image_path):
    """
    Detect the format of an image file
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        str: Detected format
    """
    # Implementation details here
```

## Next Steps

After implementing these enhancements:

1. Write unit tests for each new method
2. Create example images for testing
3. Benchmark performance
4. Document the API for each new method
